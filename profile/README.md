The **EMMO** is the results of a **multidisciplinary effort** to develop a standard representational framework that is consistent with **scientific principles and methodologies**. It merges the efforts of physicists, engineers, materials scientists, analytical philosophers, information and communication scientists. 

The EMMO provides **framework for knowledge capture and interoperability** that is rooted on **applied sciences principles**. However, it's foundational approach makes it suitable for the usage in many other fields.

The EMMO GitHub page provides the repositories hosting the ontologies that constitute the framework.
